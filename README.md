## How to build

### Local build

Before run build ESC locally you need check availability and install the following tools:

* OpenJDK 11.x (another JDK version can't compile ESC) - [https://jdk.java.net/archive/](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
* Maven 3.8.x - [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

During build Maven also will automatically download and use the following tools:

* `Go` - to build `prf-tool` module

To build all components just checkout source code, navigate to checkout directory and run maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Releasing Qubership Profiler

Release workflow uses [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to prepare
the release notes, and it uses labels to group the changes. If you need to adjust the notes, update the labels as needed.

* Navigate to [Release Workflow](actions/workflows/release.yaml)
* Click on `Run workflow`
* Select the branch name to be released
* By default, release workflow would pick the release version from `gradle.properties`, and you can overrided it if needed
* Click on `Run workflow`

The release workflow would:
* Check if the release tag `v...` does not exist yet, otherwise it would terminate
* Bump the version in `gradle.properties` to the release version (e.g., if the manually provided version differs)
* Build and publish the artifacts to Central Portal
* Create the release tag and publish GitHub release
* Bump the version in `gradle.properties` to the next patch version
