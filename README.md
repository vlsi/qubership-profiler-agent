## How to build

### Local build

Before run build ESC locally you need check availability and install the following tools:

* OpenJDK 11.x (another JDK version can't compile ESC) - [https://jdk.java.net/archive/](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
* Maven 3.8.x - [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

During build Maven also will automatically download and use the following tools:

* `Go` - to build `prf-tool` module

To build all components just checkout source code, navigate to checkout directory and run maven build:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Releasing Qubership Profiler

This project defines a [manual release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml).

To trigger a release, go to the
ðŸ‘‰ [Actions tab â†’ release.yaml](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-profiler-agent/actions/workflows/release.yaml) and run it manually.

The release workflow uses [Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to prepare
release notes, and it uses labels to group the changes. If you need to adjust the notes, update the labels as needed.

Here's the full step-by-step:
1. Navigate to [Release Workflow](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-profiler-agent/actions/workflows/release.yaml)
1. Click on `Run workflow`
1. Select the branch name to be released
1. By default, release workflow would pick the release version from `gradle.properties`, and you can overrided it if needed
1. Click on `Run workflow`

The release workflow would perform the following steps:
1. Check if the release tag `v...` does not exist yet, otherwise it would terminate
1. Bump the version in `gradle.properties` to the release version (e.g., if the manually provided version differs)
1. Build and publish the artifacts to Central Portal
1. Create the release tag and publish GitHub release
1. Bump the version in `gradle.properties` to the next patch version
